## Working with CLI

### Connecting to consoles

- ```who``` - displays info about connection
- ```tty``` - display terminal device (?)
- switching between consoles: ctrl + alt + Fx | ```chvt 1...7```
- logging out: ctrl + d | ```exit``` | ```logout```

# Helper

- ```ctrl + l``` - clear the screen
- ```echo $<name>``` - list env variables that start with name
